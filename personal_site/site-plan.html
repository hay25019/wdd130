        The Youth Theatre of Idaho is on a mission to give youth a chance to express themselves through acting. Not only do we offer several plays a year that they can participate in, but they can vote on the plays we do next year, so that they have a voice and can choose what plays they take part in. They can even give opinions on what the plays should be like!

        Currently, we are acquiring talent for Treasure Island, Captain Hook, Beauty and the Beast, and More!

        If you would like to sign up or buy tickets, click here.

        Help us decide what to offer next year!
