        <h2>The Youth Theatre of Idaho is on a mission to give youth a chance to express themselves through acting. Not only do we offer several plays a year that they can participate in, but they can vote on the plays we do next year, so that they have a voice and can choose what plays they take part in. They can even give opinions on what the plays should be like!</h2>
